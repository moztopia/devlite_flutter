# devlite_flutter

A new Flutter project template.

This file definitely eneds work.

Once you close this, open the folder in code andgo to the assets\configuration.json file. This is where the basic paramters for this file are stored.

Things I know:

It needs more foundational work. I will add localization services and clean up the duplicity in the bottom navigation. In fact, I would prefer to have a much cleaner widget section.

Open an issue if you see anything you want changed.

I have been writing code for almost 40 years, but Flutter code for a little over a year. This project is an ever evolving way for me to understand this space better.
